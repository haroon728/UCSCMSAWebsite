				The Muslim Student Association strives to bring together Muslims of different backgrounds into one unified, 
				organized and proactive community, and provides an environment that facilitates a basic, sustainable and 
				comprehensive practice of Islam. The MSA adheres to the Qur'an and the example set by the Prophet Muhammad 
				(peace be upon him), and aspires to educate others of Islam. The MSA stands upon the principles of social justice, 
				spiritual development, collective action, muslim/non-muslim community service, individual leadership and personal 
				responsibility.

				Basically we're just a club where muslims can come together with other muslims and practice our faith! We 
				Love to socialize, eat out, play sports and just have fun while simultaneously help each other become 
				better muslims. Non-muslims are absolutely welcome. We have Jummah prayer every Friday at 1:30 and Qur'an 
				readings every Thursday night. Feel free to come to either of these or any of our other Events if interested!<br>

				Assalamualaikum(May peace be upon you)<br>
